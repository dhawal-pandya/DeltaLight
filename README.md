# DeltaLight üöÄ

**How fast is light? A sleek, interactive calculator to convert vast (and minuscule) distances into the time it takes for light to travel them.**

I made it because I once was speaking with a friend and I had sent him my location and he marked "673 km" and said close enough, and I immediately thought, huh, I wonder how much light would take to cross that much. So yeah, here we are, go nut.
